# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
This application allows a user to generate a clean, organized database of their employee team. By typing "node index" into the command line, the user will enter the relevant information for as many employees as necessary. Once all employees have been entered, the application will automatically generate a styled HTML page containing all employees' information, with each individual employee on their own card.
